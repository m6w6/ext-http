Known Issues
============

Windows:
	If you keep getting "SSL connect error" when trying to issue
		requests, try another (newer) libeay32.dll/ssleay32.dll pair.

Internals:
	Inflating raw deflated data causes a re-initialization of the inflate
		stream where the corresponding window bits are modified to tell libz
		to not check for zlib header bytes.  This is not preventable AFAICS.
	Persistent handles and "cookiestore" request option do interfere,
		as libcurl saves the cookies to the file on curl_easy_destroy(),
		cookies are not saved until the CURL handle will be recycled.
			Thus one would either need to
				* run PHP with raphf.persistent_handles.limit = 0
				* call raphf\persistent_handles_clean() every request
				* call $client->flushCookies(), which is available
				  since libcurl v7.17.1 and does not work with the
				  procedural API
	HTTP and Proxy authentication information (username/password) can not be
		unset with NULL prior libcurl v7.19.6 and separate options for setting
		username and password--which work--are only available since v7.19.6.
